# The color red basically is defined as follows
# Create an RGB color triple (r, g, b) and graph it on a 3D coordinate system with each axis being one of r, g, or b
# The color red is defined as any point that is within 127 units (inclusive) of the point (255, 0, 0) in this 3D coordinate system
# Basically its like part of a sphere with radius 127 centered at (255, 0, 0), and anything in this sphere is considered red

# Here is some more in depth explanation on what the output means: 
#   If we input a rbg value (r, b, g), we expect an output in the form (x, y) where x and y are between -1 and 1
#   The values are normalized between -1 and 1, so the absolute confidence that a color is red is (1, -1), and vice versa
#   We're basically looking for a difference of y - x = -2 when the color is red, and a difference of y - x = 2 when the color is not red
#   This is a wierd way to define red, because we can simply use one node in the neural net, but it is good practice to use two nodes as it is more generalizable
#   The reason we're not using values between 0 and 1 is because values between -1 and 1 have more flexibility and imo sigmoid just sucks as a function

# IMPORTANT: CLASS BALANCE IN TRAINING DATA
############################################################################################################
# When training a neural network for classification, it's critical to have BALANCED data
# (equal numbers of each class). Here's why:
#
# PROBLEM: If you generate 500 random RGB colors, you'll get roughly:
#   - 95% "not red" colors (473 samples)
#   - 5% "red" colors (27 samples)
#
# This is because the "red" definition (sphere radius 127 centered at (255,0,0)) only covers
# a small portion of the entire RGB color space (256^3 = 16.7 million possible colors).
#
# WHY THIS BREAKS TRAINING:
# The neural network learns to minimize cost (error). With 95% "not red" samples, it discovers
# a lazy strategy: "Always predict 'not red' → 95% accuracy!"
#
# This gives:
#   - High accuracy (95%)
#   - Zero precision (never correctly predicts red)
#   - Zero recall (never detects red at all)
#   - The network literally never outputs "red" for any input
#
# SOLUTION: Generate BALANCED data with 50% red and 50% not-red samples
# This forces the network to actually learn the pattern instead of exploiting class imbalance.
